# GTK+ 1.2.10 in the year 2024 (and beyond !) 

## Why ?

I like retrogaming/necrocomputing.

In my world, that sometimes involves running 25+ years old
[Loki Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_Entertainment)
games on modern Linux systems.

The games' installer (and patches) from that era use GTK+ 1.2.
So I thought it would be fun to be able to build that old widget toolkit on
modern systems instead of relying on old binary packages from dubious origin.
